--- v0.11 WIP

* Fixed support for static member functions, and added metadata on static-ness. (#73)
* Made ImVector instantiations single-line (#77)
* Added --custom-namespace-prefix and --replace-prefix to support custom naming schemes (#80)
* Make the imconfig.h path use the parent directory by default if --backend is specified (#81)
* **BREAKING CHANGE** Modified default output filename to be dcimgui.h instead of cimgui.h to avoid ambiguity (#80)
* Removed unnecessary typedefs from structs with forward declarations to avoid warnings on C99 compilers (#82)
* Fixed backend generation command-line to include imgui.h so that template expansions work (#83)
* Fixed (somewhat) template expansion in the case where the instantiation is unique to a file that is not where the
  template was originally declared (notably the Vulkan backend) (#83)
* Added logic to move ImDrawIdx further up the file so that it doesn't end up used by ImVector expansions before the
  actual declaration. (#87)

--- v0.10

* Added support for converting imgui_internal.h - many thanks to [@ZimM-LostPolygon] for doing the heavy lifting on this!

--- v0.08

* Rewrite the IM_ALLOC/IM_FREE macros to call the C versions of the respective functions, and rename them to
  CIM_ALLOC and CIM_FREE to avoid conflicting with the original defines in #imgui.h (#69)
* Remove IM_NEW/IM_PLACEMENT_NEW defines as they don't make sense outside of C++
* Fixed IMGUI_CHECKVERSION to use the correct function, and renamed to CIMGUI_CHECKVERSION (#69)
* Fixed parsing of type declarations with inline struct/class/etc tags (#71)
* Added support for default value declarations on structure fields. These are currently only emitted as comments
  in the C backend (as there is no immediately usable way to actually apply them), but they are in the metadata so
  other bindings can make use of them if necessary.

--- v0.07

* Fixed a bug where unbounded arrays would get emitted to the metadata as having bounds of "[None]" instead of "[]". (#41)
* Fixed structs not having associated line numbers in the JSON output (#39)
* Added --imgui-include-dir option to allow the path to ImGui include files to be specified
* Made imconfig.h get parsed by default to check for extra options, and added --config-include to allow custom config
  files (of the type you would use the IMGUI_USER_CONFIG define to supply) to be included as well. This option reads
  and uses such files but does not emit their contents to the .h file (on the assumption that they are getting included
  there by regular means). It does however emit that information to the JSON output.
* Standardised the rule that "metadata elements are omitted if not known" and removed cases where they were omitted
  when not their default values. (#42)
* Made the JSON generator include #defines with no actual value (#43)
* Fixed a bug where DOM elements inside preprocessor conditionals didn't get enumerated under some circumstances
* Added --generateunformattedfunctions to generate versions of string format functions that don't try and do any
  formatting (many thanks to [@ZimM-LostPolygon] for the implementation!)
* Fixed silly bug that caused is_flags_enum to always be set (#53)
* Fixed parsing of preprocessor conditionals containing continuations (#50)
* Added --imconfig-path to override path to imconfig.h
* Made backends use CIMGUI_IMPL_API consistently
* Worked around Win32 backend wndproc handler not getting generated (#51)
* Added :: to function references in stubs to avoid name clash issues
* Changed forward declarations to not use _t in situations where it causes problems with backends (#51)
* Added a special case for forward-declared by-value structs in the DX12 backend
* Added support for typedefs with an explicit type
* Fixed backend headers to use backends/ folder for includes, and added some missing headers
* Added --backend-include-dir to allow specifying the path where backend header files are found
* Made "fmt" arguments non-nullable by default in the metadata (#57, thanks to [@pdoane] for the idea)
* Fixed a bug where JSON metadata did not include fields that were in the else clause of a preprocessor conditional (#61)
* Fixed GLFWwindow and GLFWmonitor getting incorrectly defined with an alternate tag name in the GLFW backend header (#63)
* Added DirectX 9 and SDL2+OpenGL2 examples for Windows/Mac/Linux

--- v0.06

* In ImGui v1.90.0 WIP the callback variants of "ListBox()" and "ComboBox()" have a new function pointer type, but the
  old type is still available as an overload. Disambiguating based solely on function pointer type is problematic, so
  instead Dear Bindings renames the "old" versions of those two functions as "ImGui_ListBoxObsolete()" and
  "ImGui_ComboBoxObsolete()" respectively.

--- v0.05

* Added source information giving the original file and line number of each element to the JSON output (#39)
* Added type comprehension system, which generates a breakdown of type information in the JSON output
* Added --nopassingstructsbyvalue flag to force struct parameters to be passed as pointers
* **BREAKING CHANGE** Renamed the "type" field of classes/structs/unions in the JSON output (the one that contained
  "struct"/"class"/"union") to "kind" to avoid confusion with the actual type
* **BREAKING CHANGE** Removed the "names" field from field definitions in the JSON, and instead emit one field
  for each distinct name defined in the original source (so "float x,y" is no longer represented in the JSON as a single
  field with two names, but two separate fields). This simplifies the JSON by removing the concept of fields with
  multiple names and makes field and argument definitions more consistent.
* Renamed anonymous structures in the JSON from "<AnonymousN>" to "__anonymous_typeN" so as to avoid generating names
  that are not valid identifiers (which was the original goal, but in practice that seemed to cause more problems than
  it solved).
* Anonymous types now get a description correctly emitted in the JSON at the point of use like other types.
* **BREAKING CHANGE** Type declarations for arrays in the JSON now include the array bounds (in addition to having
  is_array set to True)
* Added an "is_nullable" annotation to pointers in type descriptions which indicates if the pointer is "allowed" to be
  null. If no value is present this means Dear Bindings doesn't know (and code should assume it can be null). At present
  this only affects pointers which were converted from references, as in that case we know the value should never be null.
* Added experimental support for converting backends.
* Added stdarg.h include (for va_list), and stddef.h (for size_t) back into the header.
* Added templates for SDL2/3 backends and removed the old SDL ones.
* Fixed a bug affecting backend generation where if an extern "C" block was immediately followed by a preprocessor
  directive, it incorrectly omitted the brackets from the extern thinking that it was a single statement.
* Flagged self arguments as non-nullable.
* Added "original_class" member to JSON output for functions to indicate which class the function originally belonged to.
* Added "is_instance_pointer" to JSON output for function arguments to indicate that the argument is the class instance
  pointer (this/self).
* **POSSIBLY BREAKING CHANGE** In the JSON output, the "value" field of enum values is now the calculated (integer) value
  of the enum value, whilst "value_expression" contains the raw expression provided in the header file (which was
  previously in "value"). The "value" field is calculated for all enum values, even those with no expression (i.e. the
  implicit "last element +1" case).
* Enum values ending with an underscore ("_") are now flagged with "is_internal" in the JSON output.
* Enum values that represent total item counts (ending with "_COUNT") are now flagged with "is_count" in the JSON output.
* Added "is_flags_enum" to the JSON output, which indicates if an enum should be treated as a bitfield rather than a
  series of ordinal values.
