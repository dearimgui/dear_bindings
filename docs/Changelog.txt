--- v0.04 WIP

Put quotes back on string define values in the metadata
Fixed incorrect codegen for synthetic #define elements
Changed document filename to be the output filename (fixes include guard naming)
Removed "#pragma once" removal (by default)
Added a protective "extern C" around the majority of the header file, and removed it from the generated binding CPP
Fixed blank lines emitting indenting
Fixed invalid use of "static" in linkage specification [@rokups]
Added alignment for enum/structure members and function names
Added support for ImStr
Added auto-generation of variant functions that take const char* instead of ImStr
Suppressed generation of default argument variants for trivial cases and uncommon functions to reduce clutter
Fixed incorrect disambiguation of function pairs that appear in the #if/#else blocks of the same preprocessor conditional
Fixed incorrect generation of conditionals around code in #else blocks
Added support for (read: removal of) constexpr
Fixed disambiguation of default argument functions resulting in Ex functions with names that don't match their argument list (#11)
Reduced number of Ex functions (when trailing arguments are trivial to fill, e.g. flags = 0, an Ex functions is not warranted). (#10)
Split code_dom into multiple files for tidiness and refactored the modules a bit
Improved the header template system somewhat and added a header to all files (#18, #22)
Made it possible to configure types/names of "trivial" arguments that will not get default helpers generated (#24)
Changed order of Ex functions relative to the original (#23)
Added support for forcing disambiguation to disambiguate all variants of a function (#11)
Added support to tell disambiguation to prioritise certain argument types (#11)
Added function renaming and used it to tidy up ImGui_GetColorU32 and ImGui_IsRectVisible (#11, #25)
Added support for forward declaration of enums and enum storage types
Fixed issue #26 where (void) to declarations of C functions with no arguments was omitted in some cases

--- v0.03

Added alignment for comment indentation
Added command line arguments
Renamed templates to make them easier to match with source files
Added struct forward declarations to metadata
Added ImVector_Construct() and ImVector_Destruct() helpers
Added typedefs to the metadata output
Added parsed versions of complex types to the metadata output
Added marking of internal API elements
Fixed line comments on preprocessor directives getting treated as part of the directive
Added better #define parsing
Added defines to metadata output
Tidied up directory structure a bit
Fixed metadata conditionals not getting generated correctly for else blocks
Fixed spelling of "preceding" in metadata
Removed help reference to processing imgui_internal.h for now in case it confuses people

--- v0.02

Removed some more ImVector functions that don't compile correctly due to the lack of operator== on certain types
Removed ImNewWrapper on newer ImGui versions
Made LogTextV() only get added on ImGui version that don't supply it themselves
Renamed IMGUI_API to CIMGUI_API
Added (void) to declarations of C functions with no arguments
Fixed field declarations not identifying the IMGUI_API prefix
Made self parameters on const functions be const
Got rid of excessive use of struct qualifier and added autogenerated forward declarations to compensate
Removed unnecessary header files and made the stdbool.h include get added in a more sensible place
Changed ImVec2/ImVec4 to be treated as by-value types and avoid new() in their constructors
Removed hacky "original fully-qualified type" system and replaced it with "unmodified_element", which links all DOM elements back to a copy of the unmodified DOM
Changed stub code generation to include both the original and generated headers, and cast correctly when passing arguments around
Added lots of namespace-related shenanigans to deal with using namespaces to separate the C and C++ headers
Added by-value struct conversion functions
Added support for converting arrays of by-value types
Removed all of the ImVector functions as they're probably more dangerous than useful
Tidied up filename handling a bit
Added support for base class lists on class declarations
Added support for comments in a few more places
Added support for adding a name prefix to all loose functions
Make function name disambiguation aware of mutually-exclusive #ifdefs, and added manual exclusions
Fixed escaped character literals not getting parsed correctly
Fixed namespaced typenames not getting parsed correctly sometimes
Fixed #error and #undef not getting parsed
Made operator name parsing more generic and able to cope with things like "operator+=" without the previous ugly special-casing
Made it possible to have multiple header files in the DOM
Changed ImGui class prefix
Fixed function/structure removal not removing associated template DOM element
Added class member accessibility support
Removed IM_VEC2_CLASS_EXTRA/IM_VEC4_CLASS_EXTRA from generated file
Added metadata generator
Fixed comments getting incorrectly treated as part of the expression for preprocessor conditionals
Added generation of helper functions with defaulted arguments
Improved function name disambiguation to use minimal number of suffixes necessary to ensure uniqueness
Removed constructors/destructors that involve heap allocation
